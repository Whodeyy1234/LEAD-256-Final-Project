Time-based
Inclusive
Equity

Project outline via the University of Louisville:
Early in the course, students will self-evaluate their technology skill set and determine at least 
two major learning SMARTIE goals on which they will work independently during this course. Learning 
goals identified will be used to select appropriate modules, badges, and certifications using the 
Digital Transformation Center at the University of Louisville.
 
Students will provide a one to two-page double spaced, reflective statement on their learning goals, 
application and appropriateness for their career pathing, and current skills set/levels related to 
technology. Reflections should also describe the scope of the technology, provide examples of how 
the technology could be or is being used, describe how the future looks for the technology selected, 
demonstrate understanding of the intersection of race/ethnicity, class, gender sexuality, and cultures 
impact on technology,  summarize how you might incorporate a learning path for stated technology and 
provide a list of 3-5 resources that support the technology or would be good sources of support.
 
Using the Digital Transformation Center, students will map their learning goals onto a minimum of at 
least 5 badges or certifications offered through the UofL portal.
 
At the end of the course, students will briefly present their TechFUTURE in class. Students will prepare 
a short 6-8 slide deck (using .ppt or other medium) to share with the class. Presentations at a minimum 
should cover the following:
Learning Goals
Technology Mapping
Badges Earned
Application to Career Path
Connection to the Future of Work
Prototype or outline of Applied Learning project

Additionally, students will build out an Adobe Spark Website to visually illustrate their HAT paper 
with an introduction, images, and content from their paper into the website.
